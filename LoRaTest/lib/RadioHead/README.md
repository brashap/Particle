SparkFun RadioHead Arduino Library
========================================

This is the SparkFun fork of the RadioHead library by Mike McCauley. The original library can be found here: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/

Description from the original documentation: 
-------------------------------------------
_This is the RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors. It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors._

_The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/RadioHead-1.41.zip You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead_

_###Overview_

_RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers._

_Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports. Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.
Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, and a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager can be used to send and receive messages._

_It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.
In some specialised use cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.
A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run on your choice of processor.
Example programs are included to show the main modes of use._
